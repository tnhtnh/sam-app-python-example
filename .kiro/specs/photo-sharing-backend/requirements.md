# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform the existing Hello World Python Lambda application into a comprehensive photo upload and sharing backend. The system will provide secure authentication through AWS Cognito, enable authenticated users to upload photos to S3 using pre-signed URLs, and allow browsing of photos with pagination. The architecture leverages serverless AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, and DynamoDB to create a scalable and secure photo sharing platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate through a secure login system, so that I can access photo upload and sharing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses GET /login THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the Cognito Hosted UI
2. WHEN a user completes authentication through Cognito THEN the system SHALL handle the OAuth callback and exchange the authorization code for JWT tokens
3. WHEN a user provides a valid JWT token in the Authorization header THEN the system SHALL authenticate them for protected endpoints
4. IF a user attempts to access protected endpoints without valid authentication THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to upload photos securely, so that I can share my images with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user sends POST /upload with filename and contentType THEN the system SHALL generate a unique photoId and return a pre-signed S3 upload URL
2. WHEN generating the S3 key THEN the system SHALL use the format {userId}/{photoId}/{filename}
3. WHEN returning the upload response THEN the system SHALL include both uploadUrl and photoId in JSON format
4. IF an unauthenticated user attempts to access POST /upload THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
5. IF the request body is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 Bad Request with validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to browse photos with pagination, so that I can discover content efficiently without overwhelming the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses GET /photos THEN the system SHALL return a random selection of up to 10 photos by default
2. WHEN a user provides a limit query parameter THEN the system SHALL return up to that number of photos (maximum 50)
3. WHEN a user provides a lastKey query parameter THEN the system SHALL return the next page of results using cursor-based pagination
4. WHEN returning photo data THEN the system SHALL include photoId, s3Key, uploadedAt, and userId for each photo
5. WHEN there are more results available THEN the system SHALL include a lastKey token in the response
6. WHEN there are no more results THEN the system SHALL return lastKey as null

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As the system, I want to persist photo metadata after successful uploads, so that photos can be discovered and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is successfully uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL store metadata in the PhotoMetadata DynamoDB table
2. WHEN storing photo metadata THEN the system SHALL include photoId, uploadedAt, userId, s3Key, and contentType
3. WHEN storing the uploadedAt timestamp THEN the system SHALL use ISO-8601 format
4. WHEN using photoId as partition key THEN the system SHALL ensure it is a valid UUID
5. IF metadata storage fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and handle gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper AWS resource configuration, so that the application is secure, scalable, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use AWS SAM template.yaml for infrastructure as code
2. WHEN configuring API Gateway THEN the system SHALL include a Cognito JWT authorizer for protected endpoints
3. WHEN setting up Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL provide environment variables for BUCKET_NAME, TABLE_NAME, and USER_POOL_ID
4. WHEN configuring IAM roles THEN the system SHALL grant Lambda functions minimum required permissions for S3 and DynamoDB operations
5. WHEN setting up the DynamoDB table THEN the system SHALL use photoId as partition key and uploadedAt as sort key

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint encounters an error THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with descriptive error messages
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL use AWS Lambda Powertools for structured logging, metrics, and tracing
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 400 with specific validation error details
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with appropriate error message
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 500 and log detailed error information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the application to follow security best practices, so that my data and photos are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating pre-signed URLs THEN the system SHALL set appropriate expiration times (maximum 1 hour)
2. WHEN storing photos in S3 THEN the system SHALL organize them by userId to prevent unauthorized access
3. WHEN validating file uploads THEN the system SHALL verify contentType is an image MIME type
4. WHEN configuring CORS THEN the system SHALL allow only necessary origins and methods
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events for monitoring
